title: Math 692 Graduate Seminar
---

This will be the website for **Math 692 Graduate Seminar** on **Fluids: Mathematics and Numerics** in Spring 2025!  Here I revised the title so elastic solids are in scope too.

We are in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

* Course details:
  * Organizer/Instructor: [Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/), [elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu).
  * Time and place: _probably_ Thursdays 3:30-4:30pm, Chapman XXX (to be determined).
  * In-person is preferred if you are on campus!  I will set up Zoom only if it makes sense.
  * Credits (CRN YYYYY): 1.0, but **non-credit attendance is welcomed/encouraged**.

* The Github repo for this website is at [https://github.com/bueler/fluid-solid-seminar](https://github.com/bueler/fluid-solid-seminar).

* [A schedule of topics will appear at the bottom.](#schedule)  This schedule is subject to change!

## guiding principles

1. show up
2. talk about fluids and solids and stuff
3. try running stuff that does stuff
