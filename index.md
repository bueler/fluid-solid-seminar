title: Math 692 Graduate Seminar
---

This will be the website for **Math 692 Graduate Seminar** on **Fluids and Solids: Mathematics and Numerics** in Spring 2025!

Here I revised the title so that elastic solids are in scope too.  The course schedule will say "Fluids: Mathematics and Numerics", but I am too lazy to make the change official.

We are in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

* Course details:
  * Organizer/Instructor: [Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/), [elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu).
  * Time and place: _probably_ Thursdays 3:30-4:30pm, Chapman XXX (to be determined).
  * In-person is preferred if you are on campus!  I will set up Zoom only if it makes sense.
  * Credits (CRN YYYYY): 1.0, but **non-credit attendance is welcomed/encouraged**.

* The Github repo for this website is at [https://github.com/bueler/fluid-solid-seminar](https://github.com/bueler/fluid-solid-seminar).

* [A schedule of topics will appear at the bottom.](#schedule)  This schedule is subject to change!

## guiding principles

1. show up
2. talk about fluids and solids and stuff
3. try running stuff that does stuff

## content

My idea for this seminar is that there are several math graduate students already doing fluids or elasticity research, and that broader knowledge is helpful.  This applies to me (Ed) as well.  Furthermore, it is now pretty easy to do numerical simulations of fluids and solids using the finite element method, especially using [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/index.html), the open source Python-based tool for last year's [finite element seminar](https://bueler.github.io/fe-seminar/).

I'm happy to try to start the seminar with some kind of continuum mechanics introduction.  However, general continuum mechanics quickly gets ... boring?  In any case, there are many on campus who are expert in various fluids/solids problems, and they are all invited.  As well as anyone who is just curious.  Ideally the experts can start presenting their particular models from a (roughly) continuum mechanics starting point.
