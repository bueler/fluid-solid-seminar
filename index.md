title: Math 692 Graduate Seminar
---

This will be the website for **Math 692 Graduate Seminar** on **Fluids and Solids: Mathematics and Numerics** in Spring 2025!
  
The course schedule will say "Fluids: Mathematics and Numerics".  Here I revised the title so that elastic solids are in scope.  (I am too lazy to make the change official.)

We are in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

* Course details:
  * Organizer/Instructor: [Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/), [elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu).
  * Time and place: _probably_ Thursdays 3:30-4:30pm, Chapman XXX (to be determined).
  * In-person is preferred if you are on campus!  I will set up Zoom only if it makes sense.
  * Credits (CRN YYYYY): 1.0, but **non-credit attendance is welcomed/encouraged**.

* The Github repo for this website is at [https://github.com/bueler/fluid-solid-seminar](https://github.com/bueler/fluid-solid-seminar).

* [A schedule of topics will appear at the bottom.](#schedule)  This schedule is subject to change!

## guiding principles

1. show up
2. talk about fluids and solids and stuff
3. try running stuff that does stuff

## content

My idea for this seminar is that there are several math graduate students already doing fluids or elasticity research.  Broader knowledge, with some kind of **focus on the mathematical structures underlying continuum problems**, and on **finite element formulation of the equations**, is helpful to all of us.

Also, it is now pretty easy to do numerical simulations of fluids and solids using the finite element method, especially using [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/index.html).  That open source Python-based library was the subject of last year's [finite element seminar](https://bueler.github.io/fe-seminar/), so we have examples to work from.

I figure I might start the seminar with some kind of continuum mechanics introduction.  However, general continuum mechanics quickly gets ... boring?  In any case, there are many on campus who are expert in various specific fluids/solids problems, and **they are all invited**.  Anyone who is just curious is also invited.  Ideally the experts can start their presentations from a somewhat-common starting point, before getting to their particular models.

Tsunamis, linear elasticity, seismology, vulcanology, glaciers, magneto-hydrodynamics, and water balloons are all in scope.
